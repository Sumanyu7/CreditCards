# CreditCards

## Description

This is my attempt for the Stomble Front End Technical Interview. 

Tech Stack: React.js, Firebase, SCSS, Bootstrap

### Context

The aim of the project was to create a form handling page that does the following:

- Displays an active credit card.
- Card Number, Card Name, Expiration Date and CVV needs to be real-time inputs.
- Fully responsive
- Account for error handling.
- Allows the user to store their credit card information with the ability to select their chosen card at a later time.

### Remarks

Current Result: ![Homescreen](https://github.com/Sumanyu7/CreditCards/blob/master/Homescreen.png)

For the most part, this task was a new and challenging learning experience for me. 
I had the opportunity to improve my learning of React and learn about some new libraries mainly [react-credit-cards](https://github.com/amarofashion/react-credit-cards) 
which I used to display credit cards.


#### To be Done/Improved:

- Add more error handling for edge cases or incorrect user input
- Add unit tests
- Ability to edit prior saved cards

Nonetheless, the current progres at this task was a challenging yet valuable learning experience. Check it out.
